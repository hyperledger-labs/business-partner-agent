This is a scenario that allows a developer to connect their local environment to a cloud hosted keycloak instance for the purposes of developing with the vc-authn OIDC Identity Provider

This docker-compose.yml file causes micronaut to load the src/main/resources/security-keycloack.yml file. So refer to that file for exact configuration.
