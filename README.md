# Short Description
The Business Partner Agent allows to manage and exchange master data between organizations. Exchange of master data should not happen via telephone, excel, e-mail or various supplier portals. Organizations should be able to publish documents like addresses, locations, contacts, bank accounts and certifications publicly, or exchange them privately with their business partners in a machine-readable and tamper-proof format. Furthemore, verified documents, issued by trusted institutions, are able streamline the process of onboarding new business partners.

The Business Partner Agent is built on top of the Hyperledger Self-Sovereign Identity Stack, in particular [Hyperledger Indy](https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy) and [Hyperledger Cloud Agent Python](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python).

## Current Features

- Attach a public organizational profile to your public DID (either did:indy/sov or did:web)
- Add business partners by their public DID and view their public profile.
- Add documents based on Indy schemas and request verifications from business partners
- Share and request verified documents with/from your business partners

## Project Status

A first alpha version of Business Partner Agent is available, see
[Helm Chart](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/business-partner-agent-chart) and [Docker images](https://github.com/orgs/hyperledger-labs/packages/container/package/business-partner-agent)
It is not ready for production use.  Releases are in general considered "alpha", which means API may change at any time and we do not have explicit / planned system tests (See also [Publishing](PUBLISHING.md)).

# Getting Started

The Business Partner Agent supports two modes
1. Web mode: Serves a did:web identity and allows to publish a public organizational profile.
2. Indy mode: Utilizes an identity on an Hyperledger Indy ledger (default: https://indy-test.bosch-digital.de/)

Both modes are currently coupled with a specific instance of an Indy network in order to read schemas and credential definitions.
The agent is started in Indy mode per default and tries to connect with our test network. Please refer to the [.env-example file](scripts/.env-example) to start the agent in web mode or connect to a different Indy network.

## Run a business partner agent

You can either run the agent [via docker-compose](scripts/) (recommended for e.g. development / debugging) or deploy it into a [kubernetes cluster (via helm)](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/business-partner-agent-chart).
